# hello-world
my first attempt to make something 
I am an engineering student , who is trying to explore about all these new things that i have been just introduced to .
Studying a very unique course of which me myself hadnt heard of called "Computer Technology"
It is a combination of computer science and entreprenuership , where i shall learn to be a computer student as well as a managemnet student at the same time.
Started in the odd year of 2017 , i hope of finishing the next two years with a much more knowledge of the two fleids i am pursuing.
